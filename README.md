# Tensorflow-football-model-1
I developed this script based on the Tensorflow neural network in order to predict the number of goals in a football 
match based on the last 4 years results of La Liga. The script converts the list of football teams and the results from
the games into dummy variables, so that the neural network can use the input data in terms of zeros and ones.
A quite simple system that I used for the approach to the world of the machine learning and its application to the sports. 
The results are far away of being accurate but actually the purpose was to learn about to use the Tensorflow library 
from google. 

For a more complex machine learning model applied to football please chek my second repository "Tensor-football-model-2".

The script was developed in a tensorflow environment (Firstenv). In a standard environment the import of the tensorflow 
environment might lead to problems. For a correct implementation of a new environment in Jupyter Notebook this link might be helpful:
